The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), 
giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people 
(known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, 
consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that 
protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies 
within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents of the Government, 
the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of 
the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral 
ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to 
the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal 
characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative 
powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another 
supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, 
and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

The world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] 
Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs 
perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with 
huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: 
North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, 
and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, 
such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse 
the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a 
rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate 
halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]

the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal 
characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative 
powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another 
supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, 
and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

The world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] 
Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs 
perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with 
huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: 
North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, 
and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, 
such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse 
the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a 
rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate 
halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), 
giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people 
(known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, 
consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that 
protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies 
within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents of the Government, 
the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of

perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with 
huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: 
North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, 
and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, 
such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse 
the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a 
rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate 
halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), 
giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people 
(known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, 
consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that 
protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies 
within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents of the Government, 
the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of 
the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral 
ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to 
the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal 
characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative 
powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another 
supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, 
and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a 
rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate 
halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]


The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), 
giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people 
(known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, 
consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that 
protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies 
within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents of the Government, 
the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of 
the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral 
ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to 
the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal 
characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative 
powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another 
supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, 
and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

The world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] 
Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs 
perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with 
huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: 
North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, 
and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas,
